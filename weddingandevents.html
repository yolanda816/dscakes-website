<li>The most traditional wedding cake design is usually a white wedding cake. 
    Classic wedding cakes have traditionally had white vanilla buttercream with seasonal fruits.</li>

<li>If you are having a spring wedding, or if your wedding theme includes a lot of floral elements,
     you can consider a floral wedding cake. DS cakes use fresh flowers to create a design element
      on your cake.</li>

<li>Wedding cake toppers are adorable elements to your wedding cake. there are many different
     cake toppers we can help you choose </li>

<li>if you don’t want a huge wedding cake, a mini cake may be the best option for you! 
    Wedding cake prices can be very high, so if you want to stick to a budget while still
     having a wedding cake, this is a great idea.</li>

<section id="ordercake">
<h2>When should I order my wedding cake?</h2>
The sooner the better! 3-6 months is ideal, especially if you’re not set on a design yet.
 Starting the process several months in advance helps to secure a date before we’re booked.
  It also provides plenty of time for finalizing your design and flavors. 
  All decisions should be finalized one month before the wedding.
